These are routines that are usually stored in other CIL toolboxes.  If you are running in a CIL environment, these are present in your regular path anyway, so these new copies are unneeded.  However if you are not using the CIL tool set, you need to add these to your path.  NOTE - some of these routines are quite specific to CIL expectations, for example argusFilename.  As indicated in the supplied readme doc, this routine creates long (and informative) filenames that are important to our archives and tools but may not fit your needs or standards.  While a lot of experience (and trial and error) has led to our approach, new users may want to modify this routine to fit their needs (thereby also taking responsibility for things that then break).  We also use epoch time as our standard for time.  This is a common geek approach (for example in Unix) but we supply routines to convert between epoch and matlab daynumbers.

Note also that the routine "every" is a perl script that we use to break MP4 movie into individual frames.  It requires mplayer to be present.  This type of low level routine can be very specific to your system and we leave each user to find a way to break out their own frames into a sub-directory.  If you have good alternates, this would be a good topic for an "issue" discussion.
